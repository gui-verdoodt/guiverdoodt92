- 👋 Hi, I’m @guiverdoodt92
- 👀 I’m interested in networking, and working on Python Automation Projects from anywhere.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Selenium and some other libraries to automate bots and tasks on web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything envolving Python, so it would force me to learn more and more about Python language.
- 📫 you can reach me at Beacons: https://www.beacons.page/guiverdoodt
- ✨ My first repo is on my profile, a bot to get followers and engagement on Instagram by liking and comenting on specific photos.
  - ✨ Look up and get envolved in it: https://tinyurl.com/instagbot
